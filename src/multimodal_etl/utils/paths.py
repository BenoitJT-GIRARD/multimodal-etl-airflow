"""Where this project's files are. One module answers, and nothing else computes a root.

Every path hangs off :data:`ROOT_DIR`, which is **found**, never assumed. Counting
directories up from a file only works from an editable ``src/`` checkout: installed as a
wheel, the package lands inside ``site-packages``, and the whole tree — models, reports,
figures — would be written there without a word. Finding the marker file instead means the
same code works from a checkout, from a wheel and from a container.

Nothing else in the project resolves a root. No ``sys.path.insert``, no ``Path(__file__)``
walked back three times in a script, no artefact read or written through a path relative to
the working directory: each of those is a second answer to a question that already has one,
and they disagree the day someone runs a script from another directory.

The directory names are a closed vocabulary.
A project adds its own *named artefacts* below — the served model, the published table — and
never a new root directory: a directory outside the vocabulary exists only when
a technical reason imposes it, and that reason is written down.
